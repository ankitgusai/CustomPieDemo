This is a simple Pie like view. 
There are tons of readymade libs available already, but if you have something specific to implement and dont know how to start this might be helpful. this is more of a tutorial.

Three are four step i have taken to build the View.
    -Measurement and calculation
    -View Draw
    -Item Click
    -Animation(this is still not implemented)
    
There are three atributes that can be used via xml    

```Java
        <attr name="pie_width" format="dimension" />
        <attr name="divider_color" format="color" />
        <attr name="debug_section_count" format="integer" />
```

The `debug_section_count` is only for android studio layout preview. to populate view at runtime use, 
```Java
        public void setData(List<Item> items)
```

As this is more of a guide, the code is fairly documented and each step is well explained. key parts are,
    -Math that used to the point using circle equations.
    -Click listner implemented for arch section(piece of pie).
